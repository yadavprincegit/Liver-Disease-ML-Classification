# Liver-Disease-ML-Algorithm-Classification
This repository aims to identify the most effective machine learning algorithm for classifying liver disease using biochemical data. It includes the implementation and evaluation of multiple models—such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and others—leveraging R programming to compare their accuracy and predictive performance for early and reliable liver disease diagnosis.
